git init

git remote add origin "https://github.com/vigneshrachha/git-github.git"

git pull origin master

git status

git add <file name>

git config --global user.name "vigneshrachha"

git config --global user.email "vigneshrachha31@gmail.com"

git commit -m "Message"

git add -A #adding multiple files to index in a single go

git commit -a -m "trying multiple commit" #commiting multiple files

Note: Commiting will be aborted if there is no message. 
Also, when a file is modified and if we want to commit it again, we need not add it to the index again as it is already added.

git log # to know the commit history

#Branching

git branch firstBranch

git checkout firstBranch # to switch to that branch

Also,changes made in the new branch will not be reflected in the master branch, unless merged.


#branch merging

Note: whenever merging the branch, we have to first checkout into the destination branch. 

#git pull = git fetch + git merge

git merge firstBranch

#what is a git stash?


#pushing from new branch in local repo to new branch in central repo(git hub)

Before that, create a ssh connection from central to local

1) ssh-keygen

2) copy the key and paste in ssh config in ui

3) ssh -T git@github.com

4) checkout in the branch which is to be merged

5) git push origin firstBranch

Done!

Do the same for master, if master has to be pushed

#reverting back the changes to a file in local repo.

git checkout (8 digit hash code of the commit where we need to revert) revert.txt
